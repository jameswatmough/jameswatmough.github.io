## James Watmough

Rhymes with *dough* 

I am a professor at the [Univeristy of New Brunswick](www.unb.ca), [Fredericton](www.fredericton.ca).  My official department is [Mathematics and Statics](https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/science/depts/math-stats/index.html), but my research stradles both mathematics and biology.   After persuing an undergraduate in [Engineering Physics](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), I crossed the street to the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) and the [Institute for Applied Maths](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/) and after a few fun filled years received a PhD in Mathematics under the supervison of [Leah Edelstein Keshet](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~keshet/keshet.html).  
Following my PhD research, I spent two years as a postoctoral researcher for John Tyson at Virginia Polytechnic and another two years as an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow under the supervision on Pauline van den Driessche at the University of Victoria.
